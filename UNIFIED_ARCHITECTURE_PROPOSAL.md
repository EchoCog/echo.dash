- Pattern matching and activation spreading
- Tensor-based relationship encoding

### 3. **P-System Membranes**
- Computational boundaries for security and isolation
- Nested membrane structures for hierarchical processing
- Inter-membrane communication protocols
- Self-modifying membrane rules

### 4. **Recursive Grammar**
