# Self-Evo with AI Introspection: Enhanced Cronbot Workflow

## Overview

This document describes the evolved cronbot.yml workflow that incorporates AI-powered codebase introspection to ensure accurate and context-aware note2self generation. The workflow now uses the existing echoself_introspection.py system to analyze the repository structure and provide more targeted improvement suggestions.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. AI-Powered Codebase Introspection
- **Echoself Integration**: Leverages the existing `echoself_introspection.py` module for hypergraph-encoded repository analysis
- **Salience Scoring**: Identifies high-priority files based on semantic importance and cognitive architecture patterns
- **Attention Metrics**: Provides detailed metrics about file analysis and attention allocation

### 2. Enhanced note2self.json Structure
The note2self.json file now includes:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-XX...",
  "improvement": "targeted_improvement_based_on_introspection",
  "assessment": "context_aware_assessment",
  "result": "success",
  "retries": 0,
  "introspection_enhanced": true,
  "introspection_status": "success",
  "files_analyzed": 150,
  "resource_usage": {
    "avg_cpu": 45.2,
    "avg_memory": 67.8,
    "samples": 120
  },
  "ai_introspection": {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-XX...",
    "introspection_prompt": "...",
    "attention_metrics": {...},
    "files_analyzed": 150,
    "highest_salience_files": [...],
    "introspection_status": "success"
  }
}
```

### 3. Workflow Steps

#### Step 1: Environment Setup

- Generates attention metrics and salience scores
- Identifies high-priority files for improvement focus
- Creates comprehensive introspection data file

#### Step 4: Enhanced Self-Improvement
- Integrates introspection data into cronbot execution
- Enhances note2self.json with AI analysis results
- Provides context-aware improvement suggestions

#### Step 5: Enhanced Copilot Suggestions
- Uses AI introspection context for more targeted suggestions
- Enhances request payload with repository analysis
- Provides file-specific improvement recommendations

#### Step 6: Validation and Summary
- Validates all generated JSON files
- Provides comprehensive workflow summary
- Includes introspection metrics and recommendations
