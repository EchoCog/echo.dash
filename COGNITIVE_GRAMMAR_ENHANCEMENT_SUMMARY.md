# Store and recall concepts
concept_id = bridge.remember("artificial intelligence", "technology domain")
matches = bridge.recall("artificial")

# Create and propagate echoes  
echo_id = bridge.echo_create("breakthrough discovery",

```python
# Deductive reasoning
result = bridge.deduce("AI can be creative", 
                      ["AI generates art", "Art requires creativity"])

# Abductive reasoning  
explanation = bridge.abduce(["grass is wet", "sky is cloudy"],
                           ["it rained", "sprinkler used"])

# Hybrid neural-symbolic reasoning
solution = bridge.hybrid_reason("complex problem",
