# Archived Files

This directory contains files that have been archived but preserved for historical reference.

## Legacy Deep Tree Echo (archive/archived/legacy_deep_tree_echo/)

Contains the legacy v1 and v2 implementations of deep_tree_echo that were previously in `archive/legacy/`:

- `deep_tree_echo-v1.py` - Legacy version 1 implementation (503 lines)
- `deep_tree_echo-v2.py` - Legacy version 2 implementation (503 lines, identical to v1)

These files are archived but preserved as they represent the evolution of the deep_tree_echo system. The current implementation is in the root directory as `deep_tree_echo.py` (1,161 lines).

### Why Archived

These legacy files were identical duplicates that caused code confusion and fragmentation. They have been moved here to:
- Preserve historical implementations
- Remove confusion from active codebase  
- Maintain single source of truth for current implementation
- Keep archive organized and accessible for reference

The files are no longer referenced by any active code, tests, or documentation but remain available for historical analysis.
