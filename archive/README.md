# Archive Directory

This directory contains legacy and backup files that were part of the Deep Tree Echo system evolution but are no longer actively maintained.

## Contents

### Legacy Versions
- `legacy/deep_tree_echo-v1.py` - Early implementation of Deep Tree Echo system
- `legacy/deep_tree_echo-v2.py` - Second iteration of Deep Tree Echo system  

### Backup Files
- `Echoevo.md.backup` - Backup of evolution documentation
- `Echoevo.md.backup_20250602_235227` - Timestamped backup of evolution documentation

## Purpose

These files are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding system evolution
- Emergency rollback if needed

## Active Files

For current implementation, see the main directory files:
- `deep_tree_echo.py` - Current core implementation
- `echo9ml.py` - ML integration layer
- `echoself_introspection.py` - Self-reflection capabilities

## Migration Notes

Legacy files were archived as part of the Deep Tree Echo consolidation effort to:
- Reduce code fragmentation
- Improve maintainability  
- Clarify which implementation is current
- Eliminate confusion between versions
