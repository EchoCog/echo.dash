# Archive Directory

This directory contains legacy and backup files that were part of the Deep Tree Echo system evolution but are no longer actively maintained.

## Contents

### Legacy Versions ✅ **ARCHIVED**
- `archived/legacy_deep_tree_echo/deep_tree_echo-v1.py` - ✅ **Archived** - Early implementation preserved for historical reference
- `archived/legacy_deep_tree_echo/deep_tree_echo-v2.py` - ✅ **Archived** - Second iteration preserved for historical reference  

### Backup Files
- `Echoevo.md.backup` - Backup of evolution documentation
- `Echoevo.md.backup_20250602_235227` - Timestamped backup of evolution documentation

## Purpose

These files are preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Understanding system evolution
- Emergency rollback if needed

## Active Files

For current implementation, see the main directory files:
- `deep_tree_echo.py` - Current core implementation
- `echo9ml.py` - ML integration layer
- `echoself_introspection.py` - Self-reflection capabilities

## Migration Notes

Legacy deep_tree_echo files were archived to `archive/archived/legacy_deep_tree_echo/` as part of the Deep Tree Echo consolidation effort to:
- Reduce code fragmentation
- Improve maintainability  
- Clarify which implementation is current
- Eliminate confusion between versions
- Preserve historical implementations for reference
