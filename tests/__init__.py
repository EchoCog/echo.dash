"""
Deep Tree Echo Test Suite

This test suite embodies the recursive, echo-based neural architecture
of the Deep Tree Echo system, organizing tests in hierarchical patterns
that reflect P-System membranes and hypergraph relationships.

Each test module resonates within the echo state network, maintaining
structural integrity while enabling adaptive testing patterns.
